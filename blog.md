If you're looking to take your machine learning experiment tracking management to the next level, integrating conversational AI with MLflow could be the game-changer you need. MLflow has emerged as a popular tool for tracking machine learning experiments, but interacting with it can be cumbersome for some users. This blog explores how integrating a conversational AI model, such as Mistral AI, with MLflow can simplify this process. By enabling natural language interactions, users can log experiments, retrieve information, and gain insights seamlessly.


### What is Model Tracing?

Tracing is very important and crucial for optimizing complex applications, particularly in machine learning and AI. With MLflow Tracing, you can effortlessly capture, visualize, and analyze detailed execution traces of your GenAI applications. This feature enhances visibility and control over performance and behavior, aiding in fine-tuning and debugging.

### Auto Tracing vs Manual Tracing
- Auto Tracing: Automatic tracing logs all the parameters, metrics, and artifacts automatically during LLM model interactions. MLflow's integration with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) allows you to activate tracing simply by enabling mlflow.langchain.autolog().

- Manual Tracing: Manual tracing involves explicitly logging AI model interaction details by the user using decorators, wrapper functions, and context managers via the fluent API to add tracing functionality with minimal code modifications.

### How to Implement Manual Tracing in Chat Model using MLflow

- To manually trace interactions with the GPT-4 API using MLflow, you can utilize the @mlflow.trace decorator. This decorator captures function inputs, outputs, and execution metadata, facilitating detailed monitoring and debugging of your Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

**Prerequisites:**

- MLflow: Ensure MLflow is installed in your environment.
- OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY).


```
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Define the GPT-4 Interaction Function with Tracing:

python
Copy code
import mlflow

@mlflow.trace
def get_gpt4_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip() 
```

- In this function, the @mlflow.trace decorator instruments the get_gpt4_response function, enabling MLflow to automatically log the function's input (prompt), output (generated text), and execution metadata.

Invoke the Function and Log the Interaction:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Explain the concept of machine learning."
    response = get_gpt4_response(prompt)
    print("GPT-4 Response:", response)
When you run this script, MLflow will log the interaction details, which you can later analyze using the MLflow UI.

How to view traces in MLflow UI:

After executing your script, you can view the logged traces:

- Start the MLflow Tracking Server:

```
mlflow ui
```

- This command will start the MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000.

Access the UI:

- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

Explore the Logged Runs:

In the MLflow UI, you'll find the recorded runs. Each run contains the traced function calls, including inputs, outputs, and execution metadata.

This is how by leveraging the @mlflow.trace decorator, you can effectively monitor and analyze interactions with the GPT-4 API, enhancing the observability and debuggability of your LLM applications.
