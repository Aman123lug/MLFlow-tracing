If you're looking to take your machine learning experiment tracking management to the next level, integrating conversational AI with MLflow could be the game-changer you need. MLflow has emerged as a popular tool for tracking machine learning experiments, but interacting with it can be cumbersome for some users. This blog explores how integrating a conversational AI model, such as Mistral AI, with MLflow can simplify this process. By enabling natural language interactions, users can log experiments, retrieve information, and gain insights seamlessly.


### What is Tracing?

Tracing is very important and crucial for optimizing complex applications, particularly in machine learning and AI. With MLflow Tracing, you can effortlessly capture, visualize, and analyze detailed execution traces of your GenAI applications. This feature enhances visibility and control over performance and behavior, aiding in fine-tuning and debugging.

### Auto Tracing vs Manual Tracing
- Auto Tracing: Automatic tracing logs all the parameters, metrics, and artifacts automatically during LLM model interactions. MLflow's integration with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) allows you to activate tracing simply by enabling mlflow.langchain.autolog().

- Manual Tracing: Manual tracing involves explicitly logging AI model interaction details by the user using decorators, wrapper functions, and context managers via the fluent API to add tracing functionality with minimal code modifications.
